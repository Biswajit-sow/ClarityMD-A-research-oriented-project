# Sprint 5 Report: LLM Integration for Plain-Language Explanations

## Status: Completed

### 1. What was done:
-   **Upgraded to LLM-Powered Generation**: Evolved from a simple template system to a sophisticated, AI-powered text generator using a Large Language Model (LLM).
-   **Groq API and LangChain Integration**:
    -   Integrated the `langchain-groq` library to connect to the high-speed Groq inference engine for near-instant text generation.
    -   Used the `langchain` expression language to create a clean and robust chain, piping a prompt template directly to the LLM.
    -   The system securely loads the `GROQ_API_KEY` from a `.env` file using `python-dotenv`, keeping secrets out of the codebase.
-   **Advanced Prompt Engineering**:
    -   Developed a specific, multi-part prompt template in `xai/text_generator.py` that instructs the LLM (`llama3-70b-8192`) to act as an expert radiology assistant.
    -   The prompt explicitly guides the LLM to generate two sections: a clinical summary and a detailed legend for interpreting the saliency map colors.
    -   Strong guardrails were included in the prompt to enforce the use of safe, non-prescriptive language ("suggestive of", "patterns consistent with") and to always recommend review by a specialist.
-   **Robust Fallback System**: Implemented a `try...except` block that allows the application to gracefully fall back to a simple, template-based explanation if the LLM API call fails for any reason (e.g., no internet connection, invalid API key). This ensures the application remains functional at all times.

### 2. Results & Acceptance Criteria:
-   **Acceptance Met**: The new `generate_llm_explanation` function successfully calls the Groq API and returns a dynamic, professional, and context-aware clinical summary.
-   The generated text is significantly more nuanced and detailed than the previous template-based system and includes an explanation of the visual evidence.
-   The application is now a true "multimodal" explainer, combining a visual saliency map with an LLM-generated text summary that references the visual data.

### 3. Next Steps (Sprint 6):
-   Build the final Streamlit and Gradio web applications.
-   Integrate this powerful text generator into the user interface to provide the final piece of the explanation to the end-user.
