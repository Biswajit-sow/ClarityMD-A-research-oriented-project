# Sprint 6 Report: Frontend Demo

## Status: Completed

### 1. What was done:
-   **Streamlit Application**: Created the main frontend application script in `frontend/app.py`.
-   **User Interface (UI)**:
    -   Designed a clean, two-column layout.
    -   Added a prominent title and the critical "Not a medical device" disclaimer.
    -   Implemented a file uploader in the sidebar for users to select their own images.
-   **End-to-End Integration**:
    -   The application successfully ties together all previous project components. When a user uploads an image and the analysis is triggered, the app:
        1.  Loads the best saved model checkpoint using a `@st.cache_resource` decorator for efficiency.
        2.  Preprocesses the uploaded image using the same transforms from our data pipeline.
        3.  Runs the model to get a prediction and confidence score.
        4.  Calls the `xai` utilities to generate a Grad-CAM saliency map.
        5.  Calls the `text_generator` to create the plain-language summary.
-   **Results Visualization**: The final output is displayed clearly to the user, showing the original image, the visual explanation, the prediction, confidence, and the text summary.

### 2. Results & Acceptance Criteria:
-   **Acceptance Met**: Running `streamlit run frontend/app.py` successfully launches the web application.
-   A user can upload a chest X-ray image (`.jpeg`, `.png`) and receive a full, explained analysis within seconds. The application is stable and provides all the key features outlined in the project goal.
-   The local demo is fully functional and ready for presentation.

### 3. Next Steps (Sprint 7):
-   Final documentation review.
-   Dockerize the application for full reproducibility.
-   Add final unit tests and prepare for project delivery.
